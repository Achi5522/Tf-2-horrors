                <p>Team Fortress 2 is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter game developed and published by Valve Corporation . A franchise of the Team Fortress Classic game , it was first published as a compilation of several The Orange Box games onOctober 10, 2007for Windows and Xbox 360 . [6] A PlayStation 3 version of the game followed onNovember 22, 2007. [7] The game was later self-published for Windows onApril 9, 2008. Team Fortress 2 was distributed online through the Steam system , while Electronic Arts handled in-store sales. The development of Team Fortress 2 was led by John Cook and Robin Walker, designers who modified Quake into Quake Team Fortress in 1996 .

                    The game was announced in 1998 , powered by Valve 's GoldSrc game engine , but various concepts and designs have been introduced since then. In 1999 , the game seemed to deviate from its predecessors by introducing more realistic and military gameplay, but the design changed over the 9 years of development. In the end, the game ended up looking like the cartoons, influenced by the art of JC Leyendecker, Dean Cornwell and Norman Rockwell, and powered by the game engine called Source. The game itself revolves around 2 teams, each team with access to 9 distinct characters, battling a variety of game modes set in evil genius environments.
                    
                    The lack of information or ongoing progress for 6 years in the development of the game made it appear that it was just vaporware and was regularly featured in the vaporware list among others. Upon release, the game received critical acclaim and received several awards, being praised for its graphics, balanced gameplay, comedic value, and the use of its characters' personalities in a dedicated multiplayer game.</p>
